The git-repo includes algorithms used widely in computational science, computational biology and in all IT sectors. The algorithms are divided into the following categories:

1. **Undirected Graphs:** We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graphâ€”depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.

2. **Directed Graphs:** We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.

Proper care has been taken to ensure that the speed analysis and the space analysis is done. There is a classic space/time tradeoff and the author has ensured to ensure fast processing algorithms in accordance with Moore's Law. Still there might be several errors or performance bugs at some places. Users are welcomed to create PR's or fork the repository to create better performing algorithms.
