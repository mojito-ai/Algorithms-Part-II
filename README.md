The git-repo includes algorithms used widely in computational science, computational biology and in all IT sectors. The algorithms are divided into the following categories:

1. #### **Undirected Graphs**
2. #### **Directed Graphs**
3. #### **Minimum Spanning Trees**
4. #### **Shortest Paths**
5. #### **Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut**
6. #### **Radix Sorts**
7. #### **Tries**
8. #### **Substring Search**
9. #### **Regular Expressions**
10. #### **Data Compression**
11. #### **Reductions**
12. #### **Linear Programming**
13. #### **Intractability**

Proper care has been taken to ensure that the speed analysis and the space analysis is done. There is a classic space/time tradeoff and the author has ensured to ensure fast processing algorithms in accordance with Moore's Law. Still there might be several errors or performance bugs at some places. Users are welcomed to create PR's or fork the repository to create better performing algorithms.
