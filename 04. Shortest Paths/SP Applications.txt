1. Content Aware Resizing:

	Seam Carving [Avidan & Shamir] - Resize an image without distortion for display on cell phones and web browsers.
									 Used in Photoshop, GIMP, Imagemagick
									 
	To find vertical seam:
	-Grid DAG: vertex=pixel, edge=from pixel to 3 downward neighbours
	-Weight of pixel=energy function of 8 neighbouring pixels
	-Seam: Shortest path from top to bottom
	-To remove vertical seam: Delete all pixels on seam (one in each row)
	
2. Parallel Job Scheduling (Longest Paths Application):

	Given a set of jobs with durations and precedence constraints, schedule the jobs (by finding a start time for each) so
	as to achieve the minimum completion time, while respecting the constraints.
	
	Critical Path Method: To solve a parallel job scheduling problem, create an edge weighted DAG
						  -Source and sink vertices
						  -Two vertices(begin and end) for each job
						  -Three edges for each job
						  		a. Begin to end (weighted by duration of the job)
						  		b. source to begin (0 weight)
						  		c. end to sink (0 weight)
						  		
						  - One edge for each precedence constraint (0 weight)
						 
	Use longest path from source to schedule each job
	
3. Arbitrage Detection: 
	
	Given a table of exchange rates, is there an arbitrage opportunity?
	
		USD		EUR		GBP		CHF		CAD
	USD 1		0.741	0.657	1.061	1.011
	EUR 1.350	1		0.888	1.433	1.366
	GBP 1.521	1.126	1		1.614	1.538
	CHF 0.943	0.698 	0.620	1		0.953
	CAD 0.995	0.732	0.650	1.049	1

	$1000 = 741 Euros = 1012.206 Canadian Dollars = $1007.14497
	
	Currency exchange graph: 
		-vertex=currency
		-Edge=translation, with weight equal to exchange rat
		-Find a directed cycle whose product of edges is >=1
		
	To express as negative cycle detection problem: Model by taking logs
		-Let weight of edge v->w be -ln(exchange rate of currency v to w)
		-Multiplication turns into addition: >1 turns to <0
		-Find a directed cycle whose sum of edge weights is <0 (negative cycle)
