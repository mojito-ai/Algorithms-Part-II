1. Content Aware Resizing:

	Seam Carving [Avidan & Shamir] - Resize an image without distortion for display on cell phones and web browsers.
									 Used in Photoshop, GIMP, Imagemagick
									 
	To find vertical seam:
	-Grid DAG: vertex=pixel, edge=from pixel to 3 downward neighbours
	-Weight of pixel=energy function of 8 neighbouring pixels
	-Seam: Shortest path from top to bottom
	-To remove vertical seam: Delete all pixels on seam (one in each row)
	
2. Parallel Job Scheduling (Longest Paths Application):

	Given a set of jobs with durations and precedence constraints, schedule the jobs (by finding a start time for each) so
	as to achieve the minimum completion time, while respecting the constraints.
