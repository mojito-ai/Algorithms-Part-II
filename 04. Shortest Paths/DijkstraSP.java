/*
 * Edsger W. Dijkstra [Turing Award 1972]
 * 1. Do only what only you can do
 * 2. In their capacity as a tool, computers will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture. In their capacity as intellectual challenge, they are without precedent in the cultural history of mankind.
 * 3. The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.
 * 4. It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
 * 5. APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.
 * 6. Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California.
