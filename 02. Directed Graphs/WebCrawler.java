/**
* <h1>Web Crawler: Digraph BFS application. Crawl Internet, starting from some root website. </h1>
* 
* <li> The Internet is a digraph. Use BFS with implicit digraph
* <li> Start at some root website (say https://www.princeton.edu)
* <li> Maintain a Queue of websites to explore
* <li> Maintain a SET of discovered websites.
* <li> Dequeue the next website and enqueue websites to which it links (provided you haven't done so before)
* <li> Why not DFS? Internet is not fixed (some pages generate new ones when visited and this could trap search)
