* <h1> Longest Repeated Substring: Given a string of N characters, find the longest repeated substring

* <li> Brute force: Try all indices i & j for start of possible match.
* <li> Compute longest common prefix (LCP) for each pair.
* <li> Running time: N^2/2 possible choices for i & j. Finding longest common prefix takes atmost D character compares. 
* <li> Time ~ Dn^2 ; where D is the length of the longest common prefix
