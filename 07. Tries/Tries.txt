1. T9 Texting: Type text messages on a phone keyboard

		- Multi Tap input: Enter a letter by repeatedly pressing a key until the desired letter appears
		
		- T9 text input: A much faster and fun way to enter text 
						i. Find all words that correspond to given sequence of numbers.
					   ii. Press 0 to see all completion options.
					   
		E.g. hello
		
		> Multi Tap: 4 4 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6
		> T9: 4 3 5 5 6
		
		Implementation: A 9-way Trie where a key is a sequence of numbers and the value is the set of words in the dictionary
						corresponding to that numeric sequence.
						
2. Patricia Trie: Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric

		- Remove one way branching
		- Each node represents a sequence of characters
		- Implementation:						No one way branching
								|shell|
								/      \
							      |s|    |fish|
							  
		- Applications: Database search
						P2P network search
						IP Routing tables: Longest prefix match
						Compressed quad-tree for N body simulation
						Efficiently storing and querying XML documents
						
		- Also known as Crit-bit tree , Radix tree
		
3. Suffix tree: Patricia trie of suffixes of a string
				Linear time construction
				
		-Applications: Linear time - Longest repeated substring, longest common substring, longest palindromic substring, substring search, Tandem repeats
					   Computational Biology databases (BLAST, FASTA)
					   
4. Summary of String ST: A success story in algorithm design and analysis

		- Red-Black BST: Performance guarantee - log N key compares
						 Supports ordered ops in API
						 
		- Hash Tables: Performance guarantee - Constant number of probes
					   Requires good hash function for key type
					   
		- Tries, R-way, TST : Performance guarantee - log N characters accessed
						      Supports character based operations
						    
		  Bottom line: You can get at anything by examining 50-100 bits.
