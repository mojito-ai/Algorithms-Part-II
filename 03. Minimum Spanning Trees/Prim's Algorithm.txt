Prim's Algorithm:

	- Start with vertex 0 and greedily grow tree T.
	- Add to T the minimum weight edge having exactly one endpoint in T.
	- Repeat until T-1 edges.
	
Proof of correctness: [Jarnik 1930, Dijkstra 1957, Prim 1959]
	
	- Prim's algorithm is a special case of Greedy MST algorithm
	- Suppose edge e=min weight edge connecting a vertex on the tree to a vertex not on the tree
	- Cut=Set of vertices on the tree (connected)
	- No crossing edge is black
	- No edge has a lower weight
