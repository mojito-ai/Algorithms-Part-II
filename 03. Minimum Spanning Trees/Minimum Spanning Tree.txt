Introduction to MSTs: 

1. Given: An undirected graph G with positive edge weights (connected)
2. Define: A spanning Tree of G is a subgraph T that is both a tree (connected and acyclic) and spanning (includes all of the edges)
3. Goal: Find a minimum weight spanning tree

Applications:
	a. MST of bicycle routes in North Seattle (Network Design)
	b. MST of random graph (Models of nature)
	c. MST describes arrangement of nuclei in the epithelium for cancer research (Medical Image Processing)
	d. MST dithering (Remove Fuzziness in medical analysis)
	e. Cluster Analysis
	f. Max Bottleneck paths
	g. Real time face verification
	h. Image registration with Renyl entropy
	i. LDPC codes for error corrections
	j. Find road networks in satellite and ariel imagery
	k. Autoconfig protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network.
	l. Approximation Alogrithms for NP-hard problems (TSP, Steiner Tree)
	m. Network Design (Communication, electrical, computer, road, hydraulic)
