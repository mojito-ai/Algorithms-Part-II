1. NP: NP is the class of all search problems. (Note: classic definition limits NP to yes-no problems)

		problem 		description 					poly-time algorithm 		instance I 			solution S
		
		LSOLVE			Find a vector x that			Gaussian elimination
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax = b
			
		LP				Find a vector x that			Ellipsoid
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax ≤ b ellipsoid
		

		ILP				Find a binary vector x			???
		( A, b )		that satisfies Ax ≤ b
		
	
		SAT				Find a boolean vector x			???
		( Φ, b )		that satisfies Φ(x) = b
		


		FACTOR			Find a nontrivial factor		??? 						147573952589676412927 193707721
		( x )			of the integer x
		

		Significance. What scientists and engineers aspire to compute feasibly.
		
2. P: P is the class of search problems solvable in poly-time.

		problem 		description 					poly-time algorithm 
		
		LSOLVE			Find a vector x that			Gaussian elimination
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax = b				(Edmonds 1967)
			
		LP				Find a vector x that			Ellipsoid
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax ≤ b ellipsoid		(Khachiyan 1979)
		

		SORT			Find a permutation that			mergesort
		( a )			puts array a in order			(von Neumann 1945)
		
		
		STCONN			Find a path in a				Depth-First search
		( G, s, t )		graph G from s to t				(Thesus)
		
		Significance. What scientists and engineers do compute feasibly.

3. Nondeterminism: Nondeterministic machine can guess the desired solution.

		Ex. int[] a = new int[N];
			・Java: initializes entries to 0.
			・Nondeterministic machine: initializes entries to the solution!
			
		Ex. Turing machine.
			・Deterministic: state, input determines next state.
			・Nondeterministic: more than one possible next state.
			
		NP. Search problems solvable in poly time on a nondeterministic TM.
		
4. Extended Church-Turing thesis

		P = search problems solvable in poly-time in the natural world.
		Evidence supporting thesis. True for all physical computers.
		
		Natural computers? No successful attempts (yet).
		Ex. Computing Steiner trees with soap bubbles
		STEINER: Find set of lines of minimal length connecting N given points
		
		Implication. To make future computers more efficient, suffices to focus on improving implementation of existing designs.
