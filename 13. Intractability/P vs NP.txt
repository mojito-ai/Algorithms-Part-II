1. NP: NP is the class of all search problems. (Note: classic definition limits NP to yes-no problems)

		problem 		description 					poly-time algorithm 		instance I 			solution S
		
		LSOLVE			Find a vector x that			Gaussian elimination
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax = b
			
		LP				Find a vector x that			Ellipsoid
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax ≤ b ellipsoid
		

		ILP				Find a binary vector x			???
		( A, b )		that satisfies Ax ≤ b
		
	
		SAT				Find a boolean vector x			???
		( Φ, b )		that satisfies Φ(x) = b
		


		FACTOR			Find a nontrivial factor		??? 						147573952589676412927 193707721
		( x )			of the integer x
		

		Significance. What scientists and engineers aspire to compute feasibly.
		
2. P: P is the class of search problems solvable in poly-time.

		problem 		description 					poly-time algorithm 
		
		LSOLVE			Find a vector x that			Gaussian elimination
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax = b				(Edmonds 1967)
			
		LP				Find a vector x that			Ellipsoid
		( A, b )		satisfies Ax ≤ b ellipsoid		(Khachiyan 1979)
		

		SORT			Find a permutation that			mergesort
		( a )			puts array a in order			(von Neumann 1945)
		
		
		STCONN			Find a path in a				Depth-First search
		( G, s, t )		graph G from s to t				(Thesus)
		
		Significance. What scientists and engineers do compute feasibly.

3. Nondeterminism: Nondeterministic machine can guess the desired solution.

		Ex. int[] a = new int[N];
			・Java: initializes entries to 0.
			・Nondeterministic machine: initializes entries to the solution!
			
		Ex. Turing machine.
			・Deterministic: state, input determines next state.
			・Nondeterministic: more than one possible next state.
			
		NP. Search problems solvable in poly time on a nondeterministic TM.
		
4. Extended Church-Turing thesis

		P = search problems solvable in poly-time in the natural world.
		Evidence supporting thesis. True for all physical computers.
		
		Natural computers? No successful attempts (yet).
		Ex. Computing Steiner trees with soap bubbles
		STEINER: Find set of lines of minimal length connecting N given points
		
		Implication. To make future computers more efficient, suffices to focus on improving implementation of existing designs.
		
5. P vs. NP

		Q. Being creative vs. appreciating creativity?
			Ex. Mozart composes a piece of music; our neurons appreciate it.
			Ex. Wiles proves a deep theorem; a colleague referees it.
			Ex. Boeing designs an efficient airfoil; a simulator verifies it.
			Ex. Einstein proposes a theory; an experimentalist validates it.
			
		Computational analog. Does P = NP?
		
		P. Class of search problems solvable in poly-time.
		NP. Class of all search problems.

		Two worlds.
			If P = NP… Poly-time algorithms for SAT, ILP, TSP, FACTOR, …
			If P ≠ NP… Would learn something fundamental about our universe.
			
6. Classifying Problems

		A key problem: satisfiability
		SAT. Given a system of boolean equations, find a solution.
		
		x'1 or x2 or x3 = true
		x1 or x'2 or x3 = true
		x'1 or x'2 or x'3 = true
		x'1 or x'2 or x4 = true
		
		Key applications.
			・Automatic verification systems for software.
			・Electronic design automation (EDA) for hardware.
			・Mean field diluted spin glass model in physics.
			・...
	
		Exhaustive Search			
				Q. How to solve an instance of SAT with n variables?
				A. Exhaustive search: try all 2n truth assignments.
				
				Q. Can we do anything substantially more clever?
				Conjecture. No poly-time algorithm for SAT.
