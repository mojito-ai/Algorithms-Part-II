Introduction:

	1. Questions about computations
	
		Q. What is a general-purpose computer?
		Q. Are there limits on the power of digital computers?
		Q. Are there limits on the power of machines we can build?
		
		David Hilbert, Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, John von Neumann
		
	2. A simple model of computation: DFAs
	
		Tape.
			・Stores input.
			・One arbitrarily long strip, divided into cells.
			・Finite alphabet of symbols.
		
		Tape head.
			・Points to one cell of tape.
			・Reads a symbol from active cell.
			・Moves one cell at a time.
			
		Q. Is there a more powerful model of computation?
		A. Yes.
		
	3. A universal model of computation: Turing machines
	
		Tape.
			・Stores input, output, and intermediate results.
			・One arbitrarily long strip, divided into cells.
			・Finite alphabet of symbols.
			
		Tape head.
			・Points to one cell of tape.
			・Reads a symbol from active cell.
			・Writes a symbol to active cell.
			・Moves one cell at a time.
			
		Q. Is there a more powerful model of computation?
		A. No!
		
	4. Church-Turing thesis (1936)
	
		Turing machines can compute any function that can be computed by a physically harnessable process of the natural world.
		
		Remark. "Thesis" and not a mathematical theorem because it's a statement about the physical world and not subject to proof.
		
		Use simulation to prove models equivalent.
			・Android simulator on iPhone.
			・iPhone simulator on Android.
			
		Implications.
			・No need to seek more powerful machines or languages.
			・Enables rigorous study of computation (in this universe).
			
		Bottom line. Turing machine is a simple and universal model of computation.
