Introduction:

	1. Questions about computations
	
		Q. What is a general-purpose computer?
		Q. Are there limits on the power of digital computers?
		Q. Are there limits on the power of machines we can build?
		
		David Hilbert, Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, John von Neumann
		
	2. A simple model of computation: DFAs
	
		Tape.
			・Stores input.
			・One arbitrarily long strip, divided into cells.
			・Finite alphabet of symbols.
		
		Tape head.
			・Points to one cell of tape.
			・Reads a symbol from active cell.
			・Moves one cell at a time.
