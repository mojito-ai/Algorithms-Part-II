/**
* <h1> <b>Data Compression:</b> Various techniques and applications of data compression</h1>
* 
* <li> 1. Compression reduces the size of a file:
* <li> To save space when storing it.
* <li> To save time when transmitting it.
* <li> Most files have lots of redundancy.
* 
* <li> 2. Who needs compression?
* <li> Moore's law: # transistors on a chip doubles every 18–24 months.
* <li> Parkinson's law: data expands to fill space available.
* <li> Text, images, sound, video, …
* 
* <li> “ Everyday, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data—so much that
* 		 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last
* 		 two years alone. ” — IBM report on big data (2011)
* 
* <li> Basic concepts ancient (1950s), best technology developed recently.
