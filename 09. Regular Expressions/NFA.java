	 * 1. Kleene's Theorem: [Stephen Kleene, Princeton]
	 * -For any DFA, there exists an RE that describes the same set of strings.
	 * -For any RE, there exists a DFA that recognises the same set of strings.

	 * 2. Pattern matching implementation: Basic plan (first attempt) - Ken Thompson
	 * 
	 * Overview is the same as for KMP
	 * -No backup in text input stream
	 * -Linear time guarantee
	 * 
	 * Underlying implementation: Deterministic finite state automata
	 * 
	 * Basic plan [Apply Kleene's theorem]
	 * -Build DFA from RE
	 * -Simulate DFA with text as input
	 * 
	 * text 				DFA for pattern
	 * AAAABD				(A*B|AC)D					accept=pattern matches text
	 * 													reject=pattern does not match text
	 * 
	 * Bad news: Basic plan is infeasible [DFA may have exponential number of states]
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 3. Pattern matching implementation: Basic plan (revised attempt)
	 * 
	 * Overview is the same as for KMP
	 * -No backup in text input stream
	 * -Quadratic time guarantee (linear time typical)
