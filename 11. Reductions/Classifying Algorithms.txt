Classifying Algorithms Summary

		Desiderata. Problem with algorithm that matches lower bound.
		Ex. Sorting and convex hull have complexity N log N.
		
		Desiderata'. Prove that two problems X and Y have the same complexity.
			・First, show that problem X linear-time reduces to Y.
			・Second, show that Y linear-time reduces to X.
			・Conclude that X and Y have the same complexity.
			
Caveat

		SORT. Given N distinct integers, rearrange them in ascending order.
		CONVEX HULL. Given N points in the plane, identify the extreme points of the convex hull (in counterclockwise order).
		
		Proposition. SORT linear-time reduces to CONVEX HULL.
		Proposition. CONVEX HULL linear-time reduces to SORT.
		Conclusion. SORT and CONVEX HULL have the same complexity.
		
		A possible real-world scenario.
			・System designer specs the APIs for project.
			・Alice implements sort() using convexHull().
			・Bob implements convexHull() using sort().
			・Infinite reduction loop!
			・Who's fault?
			
Integer arithmetic reductions

		Integer multiplication. Given two N-bit integers, compute their product.
		Brute force. N^2 bit operations.
