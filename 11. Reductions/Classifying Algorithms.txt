Classifying Algorithms Summary

		Desiderata. Problem with algorithm that matches lower bound.
		Ex. Sorting and convex hull have complexity N log N.
		
		Desiderata'. Prove that two problems X and Y have the same complexity.
			・First, show that problem X linear-time reduces to Y.
			・Second, show that Y linear-time reduces to X.
			・Conclude that X and Y have the same complexity.
