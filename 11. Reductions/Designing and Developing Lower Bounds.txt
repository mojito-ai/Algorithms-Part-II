Designing Algorithms

		Def. Problem X reduces to problem Y if you can use an algorithm that solves Y to help solve X.
		Design algorithm. Given algorithm for Y, can also solve X.
		
		Ex.
			・3-collinear reduces to sorting. [assignment]
			・Finding the median reduces to sorting.
			・Element distinctness reduces to sorting.
			・CPM reduces to topological sort. [shortest paths lecture]
			・Arbitrage reduces to shortest paths. [shortest paths lecture]
			・Burrows-Wheeler transform reduces to suffix sort. [assignment]
