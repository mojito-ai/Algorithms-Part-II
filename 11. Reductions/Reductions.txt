1. Introduction

	Overview: introduction to advanced topics
	
	a. Main topics. [next 3 lectures]
	-Reduction: design algorithms, establish lower bounds, classify problems.
	-Linear programming: the ultimate practical problem-solving model.
	-Intractability: problems beyond our reach.
	
	Shifting gears.
	-From individual problems to problem-solving models.
	-From linear/quadratic to polynomial/exponential scale.
	-From details of implementation to conceptual framework.
	
	Goals.
	-Place algorithms we've studied in a larger context.
	-Introduce you to important and essential ideas.
	-Inspire you to learn more about algorithms!
