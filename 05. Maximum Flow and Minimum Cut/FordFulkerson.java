/**
* <h1>Ford Fulkerson Algorithm: </h1>
* <li> Initialization: Start with 0 flow
* <li> Idea: Inrease flow along augmenting paths
* <li> Augmenting paths: Find an undirected path from s to t such that:
* <li> Can increase flow on forward edges (not full)
* <li> Can decrease flow on backward edges (not empty)
* <li> When we augment, we preserve local equilibrium at vertex property
