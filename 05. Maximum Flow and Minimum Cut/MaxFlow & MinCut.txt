Introduction to MaxFlow & MinCut:

MinCut Problem:
	
	Input: An edge weighted digraph, source vertex s, and target vertex t. (each edge has a positive capacity)
	
	Def: A st-cut(cut) is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets, with s in one Set A and t in the other set B.
	Def: Its capacity is defined as the sum of the capacities of edges going from set A to B.
	
	Minimum st-cut (min-cut) problem : Find a cut of minimum capacity
	
	Applications: 
		 
		-1950s: Cut supplies (if Cold War turns into real war)
		Rail network connecting Soviet Union with Eastern European countries (map declassified by Pentagon in 1999)
		
		-2010: Government-in-power's goal. Cut off communication to a set of people.
