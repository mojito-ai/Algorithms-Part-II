MaxFlow - MinCut Theoram:

Relationship between flow and cuts:

Def: The net flow across a cut (A,B) is the sum of the flows on its edges from A to B minus the sum of the flow on its edges 
	 from B to A.
	 
	 Flow-value Lemma: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then the net flow across cut (A,B) equals the value of f.
	 
	 Proof: By induction on size of B
	 		1. Best Case : B={t}
	 		2. Induction Step : Remains true by local equilibrium when moving any vertex from A to B.
	 
	 Corollary: Outflow from s = Inflow to t = value of flow 		
	 
Weak Duality: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Thghe value of flow <= the capacity of the cut.

	 Proof: Value of flow f = net flow across cut (A,B) <= capacity of cut (A,B)
	 
Weak-Duality Theorems:
	 
	1. Augmenting Path Theorem: A flow f is a maxflow iff no augmenting paths.
	
	2. Maxflow-Mincut theoram: Value of maxflow=Capacity of mincut
	
	Proof: The following three conditions existing are equivalent for any flow f:
		   -There exists a cut whose capacity equals the value of the flow f.
		   -f is a maxflow.
		   -There is no augmenting path with respect to f.
