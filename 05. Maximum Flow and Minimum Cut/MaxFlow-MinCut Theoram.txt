MaxFlow - MinCut Theoram:

Relationship between flow and cuts:

Def: The net flow across a cut (A,B) is the sum of the flows on its edges from A to B minus the sum of the flow on its edges 
	 from B to A.
	 
	 Flow-value Lemma: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then the net flow across cut (A,B) equals the value of f.
	 
	 Proof: By induction on size of B
	 		1. Best Case : B={t}
	 		2. Induction Step : Remains true by local equilibrium when moving any vertex from A to B.
	 
	 Corollary: Outflow from s = Inflow to t = value of flow 		
	 
Weak Duality: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Thghe value of flow <= the capacity of the cut.

	 Proof: Value of flow f = net flow across cut (A,B) <= capacity of cut (A,B)
	 
Weak-Duality Theorems:
	 
	1. Augmenting Path Theorem: A flow f is a maxflow iff no augmenting paths.
	
	2. Maxflow-Mincut theoram: Value of maxflow=Capacity of mincut
	
	Proof: The following three conditions existing are equivalent for any flow f:
		    i. There exists a cut whose capacity equals the value of the flow f.
		   ii. f is a maxflow.
		  iii. There is no augmenting path with respect to f.
		   
			[i => ii]
			-Suppose that (A,B) is a cut with capacity equal to the value of f
			-Then the value of any flow f'<= capacity of cut (A,B) = value of flow f
			-Thus f is a maxflow
			
			[ii => iii]		we prove contrapositive: ~iii => ~ii
			-Suppose that there is an augmenting path wrt f
			-Can improve flow f by sending flow across this path
			-Thus f is not a maxflow
			
			[iii => i]
			-Suppose that there is no augmenting path wrt f
			-Let (A,B) be a cut where A is the set of vertices connected to s by an undirected path with no full forward or empty backward edges
			-By definition, s is in A; since no augmenting path, t is in B
			-capacity of cut = net flow across cut = value of flow f
