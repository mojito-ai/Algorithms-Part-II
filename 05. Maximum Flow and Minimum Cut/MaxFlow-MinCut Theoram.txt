MaxFlow - MinCut Theoram:

Relationship between flow and cuts:

Def: The net flow across a cut (A,B) is the sum of the flows on its edges from A to B minus the sum of the flow on its edges 
	 from B to A.
	 
	 Flow-value Lemma: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then the net flow across cut (A,B) equals the value of f.
	 
	 Proof: By induction on size of B
	 		1. Best Case : B={t}
	 		2. Induction Step : Remains true by local equilibrium when moving any vertex from A to B.
	 
	 Corollary: Outflow from s = Inflow to t = value of flow 		
	 
Weak Duality: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then the value of flow <= the capacity of the cut.

	 Proof: Value of flow f = net flow across cut (A,B) <= capacity of cut (A,B)
