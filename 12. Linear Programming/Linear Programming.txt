Linear programming

	What is it? Problem-solving model for optimal allocation of scarce resources, among a number of competing (can take entire course on LP)
	activities that encompasses: 
		・Shortest paths, maxflow, MST, matching, assignment, ...
		・A x = b, 2-person zero-sum games, ...
		
	Why significant?
		・Fast commercial solvers available.
		・Widely applicable problem-solving model. (Delta claims that LP saves $100 million per year)
		・Key subroutine for integer programming solvers.
