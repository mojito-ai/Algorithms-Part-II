Linear programming

	What is it? Problem-solving model for optimal allocation of scarce resources, among a number of competing (can take entire course on LP)
	activities that encompasses: 
		・Shortest paths, maxflow, MST, matching, assignment, ...
		・A x = b, 2-person zero-sum games, ...
		
	Why significant?
		・Fast commercial solvers available.
		・Widely applicable problem-solving model. (Delta claims that LP saves $100 million per year)
		・Key subroutine for integer programming solvers.

Brewer's problem

	Small brewery produces ale and beer.
		・Production limited by scarce resources: corn (480lbs) , hops (160oz) , barley malt (1190lbs)
	
	Recipes for ale and beer require different proportions of resources.
	Ale						Beer
	5 pounds corn			15 pounds corn
	4 ounce hops			4 ounce hops
	35 pounds malt			20 pounds malt
	
	$13 profit per barrel 	$23 profit per barrel
	
	Brewer’s problem: choose product mix to maximize profits.
	
	ale 	beer 	corn 	hops 	malt 	profit
	34 		0 		179 	136 	1190 	$442
	0 		32 		480 	128 	640 	$736
	19.5 	20.5 	405 	160 	1092.5 	$725
	12 		28 		480 	160 	980		$800
	? 		? 								>$800 ?
	
Brewer’s problem: linear programming formulation 
	
	Linear programming formulation.
		・Let A be the number of barrels of ale.
		・Let B be the number of barrels of beer.
		
		maximize 13A + 23B				profits
		sub to	  5A + 15B ≤ 480		corn
				  4A + 4B ≤ 160			hops
				  35A + 20B ≤ 1190		malt
				  A , B ≥ 0
				  
Brewer’s problem: feasible region

		Inequalities define halfplanes; feasible region is a convex polygon.
		Optimal solution occurs at an extreme point.
		
Standard form linear program

		Goal. Maximize linear objective function of n nonnegative variables, (linear means no x2, xy, arccos(x), etc.)
		subject to m linear equations.
			・Input: real numbers aij, cj, bi.
			・Output: real numbers xj.
