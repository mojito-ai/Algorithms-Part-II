Brewer's problem

	Small brewery produces ale and beer.
		・Production limited by scarce resources: corn (480lbs) , hops (160oz) , barley malt (1190lbs)
	
	Recipes for ale and beer require different proportions of resources.
	Ale						Beer
	5 pounds corn			15 pounds corn
	4 ounce hops			4 ounce hops
	35 pounds malt			20 pounds malt
	
	$13 profit per barrel 	$23 profit per barrel
	
	Brewer’s problem: choose product mix to maximize profits.

Brewer’s problem: linear programming formulation 
	
	Linear programming formulation.
		・Let A be the number of barrels of ale.
		・Let B be the number of barrels of beer.
		
		maximize 13A + 23B				profits
		sub to	  5A + 15B ≤ 480		corn
				  4A + 4B ≤ 160			hops
				  35A + 20B ≤ 1190		malt

Brewer’s problem: feasible region

		Inequalities define halfplanes; feasible region is a convex polygon.
		Optimal solution occurs at an extreme point.
		
Standard form linear program

		Goal. Maximize linear objective function of n nonnegative variables, (linear means no x2, xy, arccos(x), etc.)
		subject to m linear equations.
			・Input: real numbers aij, cj, bi.
			・Output: real numbers xj.
			
			Primal Problem											Matrix version
																			
		maximize c1 x1 + c2 x2 + … + cn xn							maximize cT X
		
	sub to		a11 x1 + a12 x2 + … + a1n xn = b1					sub to 	AX=b

Converting the brewer’s problem to the standard form

		Original formulation
		
		maximize 13A + 23B				profits
		sub to	  5A + 15B ≤ 480		corn
				  4A + 4B ≤ 160			hops
				  35A + 20B ≤ 1190		malt
				  A , B ≥ 0
				  
		Standard form.
			・Add variable Z and equation corresponding to objective function.
			・Add slack variable to convert each inequality to an equality.
			・Now a 6-dimensional problem
			
		maximize  Z
				  13A + 23B					-Z	=0
		sub to	  5A + 15B + SC 				= 480
				  4A + 4B 		+ SH 			= 160
				  35A + 20B 			+ SM 	= 1190
				   A , B , SC , SC , SM ≥ 0
				  
Geometry

		Inequalities define halfspaces; feasible region is a convex polyhedron.
		
		A set is convex if for any two points a and b in the set, so is ½ (a + b).
		
		An extreme point of a set is a point in the set that can't be written as
		½ (a + b), where a and b are two distinct points in the set.
		
		Warning. Don't always trust intuition in higher dimensions.
		
		Extreme point property. If there exists an optimal solution to (P), then there exists one that is an extreme point.
			・Good news: number of extreme points to consider is finite.
			・Bad news : number of extreme points can be exponential!
			
		local optima are global optima (follows because objective function is linear and feasible region is convex)
		
		Greedy property. Extreme point optimal iff no better adjacent extreme point.
